# SocialJusticeReform
Zoom Planning initiative for Social Justice Reform in the Urban Community through America, post COVID-19.

The goal is to come together and DO something about the many disparities plaguing our Urban Communities throughout America, post COVID-19.  Develop plans for overcoming disparities such as access to good Health Care, Unemployment, affordable Housing, disproportional Incarceration, Homelessness and youth mentoring.
